## Description

A project written in NODEJS.
The database linked to this project has a table of users
containing users registered in the system with details
Personal information and the amount of money they have in their account
and a table containing the history of the actions performed in the application.
This project accepts money transfer requests from one user to another,
Checks whether the request is legal by checking whether these agents exist in the system and whether the amount of money to be transferred is correct and there is a balance in the transferor's account
and then performs the transfer and updates the user accounts.
Attached to this project is a function to send a message to the user who receives a money transfer, which informs him that a transfer has been made to him, including all the details of the transfer.

\*\* After doing the money transfer function
`get_notification()` is activated and returns as an answer to the request : post `http://localhost:3001/api/transfer_money`
the message to the user to whom the money is transferred.

\*\*Bonus: in the payBox-logic i create the func `openConfirmationDialog()` that ask the user in the terminal And if he approves the transfer of the money the process continues.
